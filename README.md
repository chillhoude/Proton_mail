# Proton-Mail
Send an email using a Proton Mail account via a python script using selenium. This script was written since i had issues when i used,
Gmail/office Accounts to send automatic emails since they were flagged after a while. Had no problems with Proton Mail until now.

Additional Python Libraries Required:
  Selenium Web Driver.
  PY Virtual Display (Optional, only used to run script in a non GUI environment i.e Terminal)
  
  pip install pyvirtualdisplay selenium.
 
Obviously a Proton Mail Account is also required.

PS: If script is used in a non GUI environment, uncomment the commented lines for it to work properly.

Thats right about it, Hope this simple script Helps :)
